## FreeCodeCamp work

- Setup a GrowthBook account and set it to display the upcoming curriculum

- Try (And fail) to make it so Front end challenges will revert to seed code instead of saved contents

- Fixed a few year old bug involving a wrong selector in the Cat Painting project

## Goals for Next Week

- Look over the forums for help posts and guide campers to the right answer
  If there is a trend with certain steps or an oddity, fix the directions

- Look over the new front end projects and update assertions

- Continue removing jQuery from the codebase

- Be sure I learn Astro throughly for the contribute pages and better Quincy Email Archive

- See about using Rollup for packing the strip comments package

- Hopefully learn how to setup the mobile app on my computer
  Latest issue was an Flutter sdk and jdk mismatch
